New Possibilities for Sprites
-----------------------------

The combination of `image-orientation` with the [media fragments spatial dimension][mf]
specification offers an intriguing new alternative to the [existing approach][sprites]
to CSS sprites using `background-image` and `background-position`.

this can also be used to reduce the size of sprite
sheets in some circumstances by removing the need to provide the same sprite in
multiple orientations. (But see [below](#spritetradeoffs) for more details on the
tradeoffs involved.)

This is a
particularly important caveat when considering the use of `image-orientation`
for sprite sheets, as mentioned above: such sprite sheets would be an entirely
different beast than the usual approach to CSS sprites today, using `<img>`
elements rather than `background-image` to place a sprite on the page and media
fragments rather than `background-position` to select the particular sprite to
display. Although these sprites can't be used for backgrounds and the like, the
combination of media fragments and `image-orientation` has significant benefits
including tiling in both dimensions and the ability to display a sprite in any
orientation. I suspect both techniques will turn out to be useful in some
circumstances.
